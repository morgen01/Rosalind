# Rosalind
A puzzle a day... keeps the doctor away. Or so the saying goes.
This repository collects code files to tackle the challenges posed by the Rosalind project (www.rosalind.info)

The Jupyter notebook files are a documentation of various ways on how to approach individual problems. 
Remember: there is not only one way to tackle a problem.
